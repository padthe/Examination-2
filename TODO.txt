TODO
------------Requirements-------------
• Make the user able to choose a name - done 

• Make a high score list - done

• Be able to see the rules of the game - will fix soon
-------------------------------------





• Need to fix interface when game is running. Main class need to be more user friendly
currently not optimized when it comes to the text interface whenever the game is running. (working on it, currently better than it was in v1.0.0 but still not optimal)

• maybe add betting system and pickle and load to store player funds (we'll see about that)
